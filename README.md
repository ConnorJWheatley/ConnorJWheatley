- Hi, I'm Connor Wheatley.  
- I have a bachelors degree in Computer Science with a 1:1.  
- During my three years in my degree I studied and used many programming languages.  
- These include languages used for front and back end development.  
- The languages I am most familiar with and therefore would consider most proficient in are Python and Java.  
- The projects on my page are either projects I have done for university or projects I have done in my spare time.
